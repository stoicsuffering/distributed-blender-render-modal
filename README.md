## The Book of Lamentations

1. The fool dispatches a render job unto multitudes to render unchecked. A wise man shalt not only test a frame-set, but also the entire render in eco mode.
2. Even if an eco job hath been performed, if any light path bounce count value is changed by more than 40%, one must do another eco pass.
