# The Bible

## The Book of Genesis
1. On the first day, God entered the project directory and ran `source venv/bin/activate`
2. On the second day, He populated the `jobs.ini` with the multitudes of render jobs, when He was finished, `[RUN].CURRENT_JOB` was set accordingly to His will.
3. On the third day, He populated `remote_resources/blender_addons` and inscribed the addons into the tablets of `install_blender_addons` in `dependencies.py`, that they may be spread amongst the clouds.
4. On the fourth day, He executed `modal run src/main.py`.

## The Book of Job
1. The fool dispatches a render job unto multitudes to render unchecked. A wise man shalt not only test a frame-set, but also the entire render in eco mode.
2. Even if an eco job hath been performed, if any light path bounce count value is changed by more than 40%, one must do another eco pass.
